## Overview of an NFT marketplace

An NFT marketplace is a dedicated platform for storing and trading non-fungible tokens. Items either have a fixed price, or can be bought at an auction.


Types of NFT marketplace platforms:

* Universal non-fungible token platforms sell any kind of crypto goods, be it a work of digital art or a domain name.
  * _Examples_: `Rarible`, `OpenSea` and `Mintable`.

* Niche peer-to-peer marketplaces are focused on offering particular digital assets. Y
  * _Examples_: `Valuables`, a website where you can buy and sell tweets and `Glass Factory`, where digital holograms are sold.

## Key Features Implementations
1. __Storefront__
    * NFT marketplace should have a storefront that offers users all the information required for an item: bids, owners, preview or price history.

2. __Filters__
    * Using filters, it becomes easier to navigate a site, specifically if you plan to build a marketplace place for a lot of collectibles. By adding the filters feature, users can select items by payment method, listing status, category and collection.

3. __Searching for items__
    * An NFT marketplace platform should support tagging and category management to allow users to search collectibles. Use a search bar on the site and add categories.

4. __Create listings__
    * A user should be able to create and submit collectibles. Using this feature, a user should upload files and fill in the token information such as name, tags, description.

5. __Buy and Bid__
    * The NFT marketplace platform should have a feature that allows users to buy and bid for NFTs listed on the platform. The bidding feature should include a bid expiration date and allow users to view details about the bidsâ€™ current status.
5. __Wallet__
    * The NFT Marketplace Platform should have a wallet that allows users to store, send and receive non-fungible tokens. The easiest way to integrate this feature is to provide users with a connected wallet that they already use. For example, you can integrate the most popular wallets like Coinbase, Formatic or MyEtherWallet.
